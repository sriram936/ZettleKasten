NLP
Explore methods other than regex
ML method, naive bayes = Spam detection

3 types -
	1 Rules and heuristic
	2 Naive bayes (Word vectorize) (ML)
	3 Sentence embedding (DL model)

text classification
	Vectorize text, send it into classifier to classify (naive bayes)

medical files in cloud, ocr or doc2vec to convert text into vector embedding and then classificatipn(linear regression classifier)

Facebook - Hate speech detection
LInkedIn - Fake peofiels

Stat Quest
bias: inability to caotyre true realtiion 
high biaas = basd
variance: how model performs on test fataset
lpw varianace = good
	low bias on train dataset but high variance => cause overfitting
3 things hel;p to fing sweet spit bw simple n comp mdiels regulatizstio;n, boosting bagging 

explore jadbio = justa add data automation ml
P(dear/Normal) = probability of word dear occurance in message normal
P(NNormall//dear friend) = likely hiood  of message normal if the word dear friend

lunch is not there in spam so it makes product zero to aviod it we use that black square bsically adding alpha to apply count

Naive bayes avoid grammar rules so it has high bias but low variance

**==Need to explor naive bias by code basics and link it back to nlp pipeline video link below n need tio summerixzae nlp video and write how I can apply for my hting==**

**THing ;learnt today**
while watcjion;g yt video notwa thw key things onto your obsidian so need not waste time in watching back afain

Always note the keywords whiilw watching yt videos it helps in not going back to video
helps in map video in brain



---

**THings need to learn**

not using moouse and only using leys

kearn to touch tyoe asap as ut helps ti work by directly eatching screen amke wirk efficient

Once start a work finish anf move

learn to ;use gpt to full extent it helps in worling on unnecessary tasks

Explore about enhanced yt links plugin

**Ideas**
1) Anyting I got idea write in daily note  goesa directly to idea paf]ge

2) auto word corrector in in eerything we write basically  an extetension which stops typib when we are likely to print an eroror - Using NLP

3) Auto photo resizer during screesnshot
