KEY IDEAS:

1)Recently, Mamba further advances SSMs in discrete data modeling (e.g., text and genome) through two key improvements (Mamba paper)

Protein: Composed of amino acids
	FN: support metabolism, regulating muscular movements, transport and defense
		- Polypeptide linkage
		- ==Remember names of all amino acids - Helpful in coding==
		- Glycine - Artificial Tears
		- Keratine in hair main comp sydteine
		- Arginine - In hydration in body
		- 10 essential n 10 non essential
		- Significance - All amino acids are in L form (L isomers)
		- Structures - Primary => Secondary (alpha and beta helix) => Teritiary protein(Protein folding) => Quaternary (FOlding of diff amino acid)
		- Secondary = Hydrogen bonds (Carbonyl n amide hydrogen)
		- Tertiary = Folding-hydrophobic core-hydrophilic surrounding-Xray & NMR 
		- Quaternary = Bond through non-covalent interaction
		- Techniques = Mass spectrometry, NMR, Xray diffraction
		- Protein domain - Motif: Small region of protein shared among diff protein
		- Human ph = 6.9 to 7.2 protein structure stable at this range (Hydrolysis)
		- Milk protein - Casein (When organism interact, ph changes hence milk turn to curd,, Add lemon to milk eg of denaturation)
Carbohydrates: Sacchrides
		- Mono glucose, fructose, galactose
		- DI - sucrose(g+f), lactose
		- Poly - multiple monosacchirdes linked 
		- FN: Energy source of cell (Store energy in form of glycogen)

Lipids
	- SOluble in nonpolar solvents
	- Fats, Phospholipids(Phosphate with lipids), Steroids (Cholestrol, estrogen), Waxes
	- CH2OH - CHOH - CH2OH (Glycerol)
	- Saturated(Oils we consume for domestic puroses) n Unsaturated fatty acids

Nucleic Acid
	- Natural biopolymer (Other eg rubber)
	- 3 parts - Nucleotide = phosphate + Sugar + Base
	- DNA - deoxy ribo nucleic acid
		- Adenine,Guanine,Thymine,Cytosine
		-Store genetic info (Sequence of nucleotide)
		-Template for RNA synthesis
		- Genes, part of DNA - 25k genes
		- 3 billion DNA  base pairs
	- RNA
		- Adenine,Guanine,Uracil,Cytosine   (AU & GC)
			- Protein synthesis- Transcription n translation
			- M-RNA(Mesenger), T-RNA(Transfer), R-RNA(Ribosmic)
			- No need to remeber checmical structures of AGTCU just remember the name
			- H- bond = Bond bw H and electro negative
	- Purines(AG) and Pyramidines(CUT)(2 N in ring)
Cells
	- Procaryotes(No nucleus , dna in cytoplasm) n Eucaryotes(have nucleus)
	- Chromosmes - Have dna and determine gender of a baby
	- Cell> Nucleus> Chromosome> DNA> Gene
	- On avg genes are 1000- 4000  nucleotides
Gene
	- Small segment of DNA - gene
	- Entire genetic makeup of gene in cell nucleus of an organism - genome
	- Polymorphism - Formation of twins eg
	- PCR - Polymerised chain reaction (Whole genome sequencing)(ICPCR)
	- NCBI databast (Genome sequence)

Cell Division
	- RBC - 120 days, WBC - 2 to 3 weeks
	- Mitosis
		- Division of chromosomes in cells (Daughter cels have same no. of chromosomes, Replicstion of somatic cells)
	- Meiosis
		-Cell division with reduction of chromosomes 
		- Daughter cells has half of original chromosomes, Production of gametes
	- Cytokinesis - Phase where cells divide
	- Protein synthesis
		- Cell makes protein
		- TRanscription
			- Transfer of DNA structure from DNA to mRNA in  nucleus
			- Translation = Occur in ribosomes
			- instruction in mRNA is read n tRNA bring correct sequence of AMino acids - rRNA helps in forming the polypeptide chains
			- 
			- Three stages :Intitiation, elongation n termination (enzymes act as catalyst in biological reactions)
				- RNA polymerase  (DNA  consists, recognition sites and  transcribed region)
				- RNA polymerase acts on recognition site and helical structure start t break at that site into coding strand and reverse strand
				- in reverse stand RNA starts to form
				- THen RNA is removed from RNA polymerase
				- This RNA is known as mRNA
			-mRNA 3 steps
				- Initiation = mRNA attaches to ribosomes
				- Elongation = tRNA bring amino acid and it gets attached to codan
				- Codan site is combination of 3 nucleotides which together form genetic code
				- We have codon chart (there are 64 sequences for 20 amino acids)
				- Terminator = Stop codon, mRNA decouplees and protein synthesis is done
				==- 10 mark question==
			- Basically from RNA polymerase , mRNA is formed and it goes to ribosome, tRNA contains amino acid and mg2+ plays crucial role to activate tRNA and then tRNA gets attached to codon and finallay they get attached to mRNA at ribosome, after stop codon comes, the RNA leaves and protein is formed in a cell
		- Merrifield peptide synthesis
		- Solid phase synthesis
		- Codon chart - will dictate what kind of amino acid is needed for particular protein
		- RNA - Double helix structure in DNA should unwind itself to form RNA
			- forward strand 5' -> 3'
			- reverse strand 3' -> 5'  (3 prime n 5 prime are carbon numbers in DNA's sugar backbone)
			- 5' carbon has a phospahate group attached to it while 3' grp has hydroxyl grp(OH) attached to it
Mutations
	Substitution:  Replacement of 1 nucleotide with other
	Deletions:  Deletion of a nucleotide
	Insertion: Adding of new nucleotide in strand
	Inversions: A on foward stand and t on reverse strand get reversed
		These occurs during DNA replication
		When exposed to radiation: Hiroshima n Nagasaki incident and Bhopal gas incident
	.
	Physical Ecent
Polymorphism
	Variation b/w individuals in a population
	Through duplication and Mutation
	.
	Population attribute
	
Genetic Drift
Gene Flow
Random Mating
Natural  Selection
