Twisted Pair Cables
	1. Unshielded Twisted Pair Cables (UTP) : Used in computer n telecommunication medium
	2. Shielded twisted pair (STP):  contains an extra wrapping foil or copper braid jacket to protect the cable.  (Used underground)
coaxial cable: Coaxial cable constitutes a solid conductor, three coats of insulation, and a grounding conductor.

##  Circuit n Packet Switching
 1) Packet switching: A method of transferring the data to a network in form of packets
 2) Transfer file fast, efficient and less transmission latency = data broke into small chunks of variable length. 
3) Reassembled at destination
4) Size is decided by network and protocols
## Delay problems 



## OSI MODEL



## TCP IP  




## Connection in CPT, code left
