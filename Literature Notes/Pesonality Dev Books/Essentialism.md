CHAPTER 4
TRADE-OFF
Which Problem Do I Want?

We can try to avoid the reality of trade-offs,
but we can’t escape them.

Jim Collins, the author of the business classic Good to Great, 
was once told by Peter Drucker that
He could either build a great company or build great ideas but not both.
Jim chose ideas.
As a result of this trade-off 
There are still only three full-time employees in his company, 
yet his
Ideas have reached tens of millions of people through his writing.

As painful as they can sometimes be, trade-offs represent a significant
opportunity. By forcing us to weigh both options and strategically select
the best one for us, we significantly increase our chance of achieving the
outcome we want. Like Southwest, we can enjoy the success that results
from making a consistent set of choices.

Success required making strategic trade-offs.

Anna and I met someone who had, as far as we could tell, an
amazing marriage and family. We wanted to learn from him, so we
asked him, What’s your secret? One of the things he told us was that he
and his wife had decided not to be a part of any clubs. He didn’t join the
local lodge. She didn’t join the book clubs. It wasn’t that they had no
interest in those things. It was simply that they made the trade-off to
spend that time with their children. Over the years their children had
become their best friends—well worth the sacrifice of any friendships
they might have made on the golf course or over tattered copies of Anna
Karenina

![](/ZettleKasten/Unsorted/Attachment/Pasted_image_20250727172847.png)

living the way of the Essentialist requires us to decide between our
families and our health and our work. What I am suggesting is that when
faced with a decision where one option prioritizes family and another
prioritizes friends, health, or work, we need to be prepared to ask,
“Which problem do you want?”


Trade-offs are not something to be ignored or decried. They are
something to be embraced and made deliberately, strategically, and
thoughtfully.


EXPLORE
Discern the Vital Few from the Trivial Many

Explore more, and pick the right, work on it

Space to think, 
Time to look and listen,
Permission to play,
Wisdom to sleep,  
The discipline to apply highly selective criteria to the choices we make.

Essentialists spend as much time as possible exploring, listening,
debating, questioning, and thinking. But their exploration is not an end
in itself. The purpose of the exploration is to discern the vital few from
the trivial many.

ESCAPE
The Perks of Being Unavailable

==Space to Design==

 By creating space to think and focus, students can step back to see more clearly.

In order to have focus we need to escape to focus.

 An Essentialist focuses the way
 
our eyes focus; not by fixating on something but by constantly adjusting
and adapting to the field of vision.

We can all learn to create more space in our lives.


==Space to Concentrate==
 He knew that making his highest point of contribution on a task required that he create the space for unencumbered thought.

 In other words, Newton created space for intense
concentration, and this uninterrupted space enabled him to explore the
essential elements of the universe.

I don’t mean the five minutes during your
morning commute you spent composing the day’s to-do list, or the
meeting you spent zoned out reflecting on how to approach another
project you were working on. I’m talking about deliberately setting aside
distraction-free time in a distraction-free space to do absolutely nothing
other than think.

By abolishing any chance of being bored we have also lost the time we
used to have to think and process.

Here’s another paradox for you: the faster and busier things get, the
more we need to build thinking time into our schedule. And the noisier
things get, the more we need to build quiet reflection spaces in which we
can truly focus.

 Jeff Weiner, the CEO of LinkedIn,
 In this space he is able to think about the essential questions: what the
company will look like in three to five years; what’s the best way to
improve an already popular product or address an unmet customer need;
how to widen a competitive advantage or close a competitive gap. He
also uses the space he creates to recharge himself emotionally. This
allows him to shift between problem-solving mode and the coaching
mode expected of him as a leader.

==Space to Read==
 CEO Bill Gates, who regularly (and famously) takes a regular week off from his daily duties at Microsoft simply to think and read.

In other words, twice a year, during the busiest and most frenetic time
in the company’s history, he still created time and space to seclude
himself for a week and do nothing but read articles (his record is 112)
and books, study technology, and think about the bigger picture.

I’ve found useful is simply to read something from classic literature (not
a blog, or the newspaper, or the latest beach novel) for the first twenty
minutes of the day. 

Zen, the Reason of Unreason; 
The Wisdom of Confucius; 
The Torah;
The Holy Bible;
Tao, to Know and Not Be Knowing; 
The Meaning of the Glorious Koran: An
Explanatory Translation;
As a Man Thinketh; 
The Essential Gandhi; 
Walden, or, Life in the Woods;
The Book of Mormon; 
The Meditations of Marcus
Aurelius; 
The Upanishads.


Whether you can invest two hours a day, two weeks a year, or even
just five minutes every morning, it is important to make space to escape
in your busy life.

Play stimulates the parts of the brain involved in

The Power of Extreme Criteria

 “No More Yes. It’s Either HELL YEAH! Or No,”

Extreme test:
If we feel total and utter conviction to do
something, then we say yes.

choices—whether big or small, significant or trivial—in every area of our lives.

As you evaluate an option, think about the single most important criterion for that decision, and then simply give the option a score between 0 and 100. If you rate it any lower than 90 percent, then automatically change the rating to 0 and simply reject it. 

Highly selective criteria is a trade off,
Sometimes need to reject seemingly good option, and wait for the right one. Right one may come or not, but the  very act of
applying selective criteria forces you to choose which perfect option to wait for rather than others decide for you.

It forces u to make decision by design

Assigning  numerical values to our options forces us to make decisions
( consciously, logically, rationally ) vs ( impulsively or emotionally ). Yes, it takes discipline to apply tough criteria. But failing to do so carries a high cost.

![](/ZettleKasten/Unsorted/Attachment/Pasted_image_20250731180027.png)

Making our criteria both selective and explicit affords us a systematic tool for discerning what is essential and filtering out the things that are not.

''
Always be sure of ur criteria's and then decide
While deciding something, meditate and then decide
''

Here’s a simple, systematic process you can use to apply selective
criteria to opportunities that come your way. 
First, write down the opportunity. 
Second, write down a list of three “minimum criteria” the options would need to “pass” in order to be considered.
Third, write down a list of three ideal or “extreme criteria” the options would need to
“pass” in order to be considered. 

By definition, if the opportunity doesn’t pass the first set of criteria,
the answer is obviously no.
But if it also doesn’t pass two of your three extreme criteria, the answer is still no.

opportunity
What opportunity is being offered to you?

minimum
What are your minimum criteria for this option to be considered?

extreme
What are the ideal criteria for this option to be approved?

 “good restaurant in Tirupati” vs “best slice of pizza in Anna Rao circle.”

CHAPTER 10
CLARIFY
One Decision That Makes a Thousand

In a TEAM
Lack Of Clarity about the goals and roles 
	= Confusion , Stress, Frustration
 High level of Clarity,
	= people Thrive.

PATTERN 1: PLAYING POLITICS

Instead of focusing their time and energies on making a high level of contribution, they put all their effort into games like
	Attempting to look better than their peers, 
	Demonstrating their self-importance, and
	Echoing their manager’s every idea or sentiment.

These kinds of activities are  Nonessential + Damaging + Counterproductive

 When we are unclear about our real purpose in life 
 when we don’t have a clear sense of our goals, our aspirations, and our values
 we make up our own social games

We overvalue Non-essentials
like a nicer car or house, or 
even intangibles like the number of our followers on Twitter or
the way we look in our Facebook photos

 we neglect activities that are truly essential, like spending time
with our loved ones, or
nurturing our spirit, or
taking care of our health.

![](/ZettleKasten/Unsorted/Attachment/Pasted_image_20250805175726.png)

PATTERN 2: IT’S ALL GOOD (WHICH IS BAD)

For example, pursuing
five different majors, each of them perfectly good, does not equal a
degree. 

Likewise, five different jobs in five different industries do not
add up to a forward-moving career.

Ralph Waldo Emerson said, “The crime which bankrupts men and states is that of job-work;—declining from your main design to serve a turn here or there.”

Without clarity and purpose,
pursuing something because it is good is not good enough to make a
high level of contribution.

When teams are really clear about their purpose and their individual
roles, on the other hand, it is amazing what happens to team dynamics.

Formal momentum accelerates, adding up to a higher cumulative
contribution of the team as a whole.

![](/ZettleKasten/Unsorted/Attachment/Pasted_image_20250805180354.png)


![](/ZettleKasten/Unsorted/Attachment/Pasted_image_20250805180707.png)


In the top left quadrant, we have vision and mission statements like
“We want to change the world”: 
statements that sound inspirational but are so general they are almost entirely ignored.

"Want to make the world happy"
"Make people work with their full potential"
"Make this world highly moral"

In the bottom left quadrant, we have a set of vague, general values—like “innovation,” “leadership,” and “teamwork”—but these are typically too bland and generic to inspire any passion.

"Want to live life like Rama"
"Serving people"
"Make efficient time use"

In the bottom right quadrant, we have shorter-term quarterly objectives we pay attention to, like “Increase profits 5 percent over last year’s results”; these shorter-term tactics may be concrete enough to get our attention, but they often lack inspiration.

"[[My Study Plan.canvas|Finish my 6 months plan framwork]]"

An essential intent, on the other hand, 
is both inspirational and concrete, both meaningful and measurable. 

Done right, an essential intent is one decision 
that settles one thousand later decisions. 

"[[My Study Plan.canvas|Look at your study plan]]"

It’s like deciding you’re going to become a doctor instead of a lawyer.

One strategic choice eliminates a universe of other options and 
maps a course for the next five, ten, or even twenty years of your life. 

Once the big decision is made, all subsequent decisions come into better focus.

**STOP WORDSMITHING AND START DECIDING**

 An essential intent doesn’t have to be elegantly crafted; 
 it’s the substance, not the style that counts.
 
 Instead, ask the more essential question that will inform every future decision you will ever make:

 “If we could be truly excellent at only one thing, what would it be?”

**ASK, “HOW WILL WE KNOW WHEN WE’RE DONE?”**

 mission to “eliminate hunger in the world,” but given that 
 There were just five people in the organisation, 
 the mission felt like little more than empty words.

 actor/social entrepreneur Brad Pitt, who, appalled by the lack
 of progress in rebuilding New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, had
 started an organization called “Make It Right” with the essential intent
 “to build 150 affordable, green, storm-resistant homes for families living
 in the Lower 9th Ward.”

 *The concreteness of the objective made it real.

**Living with Intent**

 Greater sense of purpose helps you chart your life’s path.

 Creating an essential intent is hard. 
 It takes courage, insight, and foresight to see which activities and efforts will add up to your single highest point of contribution.
 It takes asking tough questions, making real trade-offs, and exercising serious discipline 
 to cut out the competing priorities that distract us from our true intention. 
 
 Yet it is worth the effort because only with real clarity of purpose 
 can people, teams, and organisations fully mobilise and achieve something truly excellent.

The Power of a Graceful “No”

![](/ZettleKasten/Unsorted/Attachment/Pasted_image_20250812175203.png)

“The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing”


Strong internal clarity it is almost as if we have a force field protecting us from the non-essentials coming at us from all directions. 

With Rosa it was her deep moral clarity that gave her unusual courage of conviction.

With Stephen it was the clarity of his vision for the evening with his loving daughter. 

In virtually every instance, clarity about what is essential fuels us with the strength to say no to the non-essentials.


The only way out of this trap is to learn to say no firmly, resolutely, and yet gracefully. Because once we do, we find, not only that our fears of disappointing or angering others were exaggerated,

but that people actually respect us more. Since becoming an Essentialist I have found it almost universally true that people respect and admire those with the courage of conviction to say no.


Drucker’s response was interesting enough to Mihaly that he quoted it verbatim:

“I am greatly honored and flattered by your kind letter of February 14th—
for I have admired you and your work for many years, and I have learned much from it.

But, my dear Professor Csikszentmihalyi,
I am afraid I have to disappoint you. I could not possibly answer your questions. 

I am told I am creative—I don’t know what that means.…
I just keep on plodding.… I hope you will not think me presumptuous or rude if I say that one of the secrets of productivity (in which I believe whereas I do not believe in creativity) is to have a VERY BIG waste paper basket to take care of ALL invitations such as yours—

productivity in my experience consists of NOT doing anything that helps the work of other people but to spend all one’s time on the work the Good Lord has fitted one to do, and to do well.”

A true Essentialist, Peter Drucker believed that “people are effective because they say no.”


The point is to say no to the nonessentials so we can say yes to the things that really matter. It is to say no—frequently and gracefully—to everything but what is truly vital.

![](/ZettleKasten/Unsorted/Attachment/Pasted_image_20250812180607.png)



Only once we separate the decision from the relationship can we make a clear decision and then separately find the courage and compassion to communicate it.

## FOCUS ON THE TRADE-OFF
The more we think about what we are giving up when we say yes to someone, the easier it is to say no. 

## REMIND YOURSELF THAT EVERYONE IS SELLING SOMETHING
This doesn’t mean you have to be cynical about people. I don’t mean to imply people shouldn’t be trusted. 
I am simply saying everyone is selling something
—an idea, a viewpoint, an opinion—
in exchange for your time.


## MAKE YOUR PEACE WITH THE FACT THAT SAYING “NO” OFTEN REQUIRES TRADING POPULARITY FOR RESPECT

People approach us because they want to get something from us and feel disappointed and angry when they hear no for a short term.

But this shows people that our time is highly valuable. It distinguished the professionalism from the amateur.

A case in point is the time the graphic designer Paul Rand had the guts
to say no to Steve Jobs. When Jobs was looking for a logo for the
company NeXT, he asked Rand, whose work included the logos for IBM,
UPS, Enron, Westinghouse, and ABC, to come up with a few options. But
Rand didn’t want to come up with “a few options.” He wanted to design
just one option. So Rand said: “No. I will solve your problem for you.
And you will pay me. And you don’t have to use the solution. If you
want options go talk to other people. But I will solve the problem the
best way I know how. And you use it or not. That’s up to you.” Not
surprisingly, Rand solved the problem and created the “jewel” logo Jobs
wanted, but the real lesson here is the effect Rand’s “push back” had on
Jobs, who later said of Rand, “He is one of the most professional people I
have ever worked with: in the sense that he had thought through all of
the formal relationship between a client and a professional such as
himself.” Rand took a risk when he said no. He bet a short-term
popularity loss for a long-term gain in respect. And it paid off.

### REMEMBER THAT A CLEAR “NO” CAN BE MORE GRACEFUL THAN A VAGUE OR NONCOMMITTAL “YES”

If u know that u can't do, just say "no". Don't hang and say like "I will try to do". 

### The “No” Repertoire

1. ==**The awkward pause:**==  When any request comes, take a pause to think bfr pausing verdict.

2. ==The soft “no” (or the “no but”):==  
	“I am consumed with writing my book right now
	:) But I would love to get together once the book is finished."
	Showing people u r currently involved in your work but I would love to join when done.
	"Practise in E-mail"

3. ==“Let me check my calendar and get back to you.”==   (Indirect)
	Pause and reflect. Adi is the best example for this task.

4. ==Use e-mail bouncebacks:==   
	I set an e-mail bounceback with
	the subject line “In Monk Mode.” The e-mail said: “Dear Friends, I am
	currently working on a new book which has put enormous burdens on my time. Unfortunately, I am unable to respond in the manner would	like. For this, I apologize.—Greg.”

5. ==Say, “Yes. What should I deprioritize?”:==   (Indirect)
	 “Yes, I’m happy to make this the priority. Which of these other projects should I deprioritize to pay attention to this new project?”

	“I would want to do a great job, and given my other commitments I wouldn’t be able to do a job I was proud of if I took this on.”

6.  ==**Say it with humor:**== 
	 I recently was asked by a friend to join him in training for a marathon. My response was simple: “Nope!” He laughed a little and said, “Ah, you practice what you preach.” Just goes to show how useful it is to have a reputation as an Essentialist!

7.   ==Use the words “You are welcome to X. I am willing to Y:==  (Indirect)
	U r saying what you are not going to do n his choice to do, and what you are willing to do!
	“You are welcome to borrow my car. I am willing to make sure the keys are here for you.”
	By this you are also saying, “I won’t be able to drive you.”

8. ==“I can’t do it, but X might be interested.”==

![](/ZettleKasten/Unsorted/Attachment/Pasted_image_20250819174132.png)

### Avoiding Commitment Traps
#### BEWARE OF THE ENDOWMENT EFFECT
1) **Endownment Effect**: Tendency to "undervalue" things which are not ours and "overvalue" things which are ours.
 2) When we feel we “own” an activity, it becomes harder to uncommit. Nonetheless, here is a useful tip:

#### PRETEND YOU DON’T OWN IT YET
1) "If I don't own this item, How much would I pay or strive to obtain it?"
	We can use this for OPPORTUNITIES and COMMITMENTS
2) “If I wasn’t already involved in this project, how hard would I work to get on it?”

#### GET OVER THE FEAR OF WASTE
1) “Abandoning a project that you’ve invested a lot in feels like you’ve wasted everything, and waste is something we’re told to avoid,”
2)  It’s natural not to want to let go of what we wasted on a bad choice, but when we don’t, we doom ourselves to keep wasting even more.

#### INSTEAD, ADMIT FAILURE TO BEGIN SUCCESS
1) If any mistake is happened or happening, admit it and make mistake a part of past.
2) Don't circle pointlessly.
3) Don't have shame in admitting a mistake.
4) Become wiser man, by admitting the mistake.

#### STOP TRYING TO FORCE A FIT
1) Never try too hard to be something we’re not. Whether in our personal or professional lives.
2) It is all too tempting to force something that is simply a mismatch. 

#### Look above carefully everything is connected. 
< Endownment Effect 
=> Act if opportunity or thing is not urs and then look it importance 
=> Get over fear of waste 
=> Admit Failure 
=> Stop Force Fit into others shoe > 

#### GET A NEUTRAL SECOND OPINION
TAke opinion of someone who is not involved in the non essential task which is dripping your energy,

#### BE AWARE OF THE STATUS QUO BIAS
The tendency to continue doing something simply because we have
always done it is sometimes called the “status quo bias.”

#### APPLY ZERO-BASED BUDGETING
Instead of budgeting your time ,energy n resources on basis of  existing commitments, assume all previous commitments are gone. 

Begin from scratch, asking which you would add today.

If something no longer fits, eliminate it!!!

#### STOP MAKING CASUAL COMMITMENTS
Just follow the headline.

#### FROM NOW ON, PAUSE BEFORE YOU SPEAK
If u already made a commitment you're regretting, 
-just apologise and tell the person that when you made the
commitment you didn’t fully realise what it would entail.

#### GET OVER THE FEAR OF MISSING OUT (FOMO)
 one of the obstacles to uncommitting ourselves from a present course is the fear of missing out on something great.

#### TO FIGHT THIS FEAR, RUN A REVERSE PILOT
In a reverse pilot you test whether removing an initiative or activity
will have any negative consequences.

For example, when an executive I work with took on a new senior role in the company, he inherited a process his predecessor had gone to a huge effort to implement: a huge, highly visual report on a myriad of subjects produced for the other executives each week. It consumed enormous energy from his team, and he hypothesized that it was not adding a great deal of value to the company. So to test his hypothesis he ran a reverse pilot. He simply stopped publishing the report and waited to see what the response would be. What he found was that no one seemed to miss it; after several weeks nobody had even mentioned the report. As a result, he concluded that the report was not essential to the business and could be eliminated.

Are there commitments you routinely make to customers, colleagues, friends or even family members that you have always assumed made a big difference to them but that in fact they might barely notice? By quietly eliminating or at least scaling back an activity for a few days or weeks you might be able to assess whether it is really making a difference or whether no one really cares.

It’s true that “uncommitting” can be harder than simply not committing in the first place.

We feel guilty saying no to something or someone we have already committed to, and
let’s face it, no one likes going back on their word. Yet learning how to do so—

in ways that will garner you respect for your courage, focus, and discipline—
is crucial to becoming an Essentialist.
