TA concepts can be applied across asset classes as long as it has time-series data.

1) **_Markets discount everything_** –  known and unknown information in the public domain is reflected in the latest stock price.

2) **_The ‘how’ is more important than the ‘why’_ –** Technical analyst would not be interested in questioning **why** the insider bought the stock as long as the technical analyst knows **how** the price reacted to the insider’s action.

3) **_Price moves in trend –_** All major moves in the market are an outcome of a trend.
	- Upward movement in the NIFTY 50 Index to 18500 from 14750 did not happen overnight. This move happened in a phased manner in over 11 months.
	- Once the trend is established, the price moves in the direction of the trend.

4) **_History tends to repeat itself –_** Market participants get greedy and want to 
	buy irrespective of the high price. Likewise, market participants want to sell in a downtrend irrespective of the low and unattractive prices.This ensures that history repeats itself.

	**The Close Price –** This is the most important price because it is the final price at which the market closes for the day. The close indicates the intraday strength and a reference price for the next day. If the close is higher than the open, it is considered a positive day; otherwise negative.
