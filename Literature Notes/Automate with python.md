- Use stack overflow or "learn programming" in reddit if you have any doubts

- While asking doubs
	- Explain what you are trying to do, not just what you did.
	
	- Specify the point at which the error happens. Does it occur at the very start of the program or only after you do a certain action?
	
	- Copy and paste the entire error message and your code to http://pastebin .com/ or http://gist.github.com/.
	
	- Explain what you’ve already tried to do to solve your problem.
	
	- say which operating system and version you’re running.
	
	- If the error came up after you made a change to your code, explain exactly what you changed.
	
	- Say whether you’re able to reproduce the error every time you run the program or whether it happens only after you perform certain actions. Explain what those actions are, if so.
	
	- Always follow good online etiquette as well. For example, don’t post your questions in all caps or make unreasonable demands of the people trying to help you.

	-  'Alice' + 42  (NP)   Cant concatenate 2 obj of diff datatype
	-  'Alice' * 5  (P)   Output same string 5 times in a line
	-   'Alice' * 5.0  (NP)  String cant replicate 5 times
	
	- print(), input(), len(), str(), int(), float()
	
		42 == '42'  (False) 
		42 == 42.0  (True) 
		42.0 == 0042.000  (True)
	- Unlike java,  && = and , || = or,  ! = not except in !=
	
	- Boolean exp evaluated left to right  (x>3) and (x>5)
	
	- if: , elif:, else:, while:, for:, break:, continue:
	
	- 0, 0.0, ''  = False ,  rest all considered true
	
	- for iterable in range(5)  -  loop repeat 5 times
	
	- range(start, stop, step)
	
	- import random, sys, os, math
	- import *
